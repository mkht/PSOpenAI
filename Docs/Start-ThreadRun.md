## DESCRIPTION

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Start-ThreadRun -ThreadId 'thread_abc123' -Assistant 'asst_abc123'
```

Required: True
Position: 1
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
```

### -Model
The name of the Model to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used.

```yaml

### -ReasoningEffort
**o1 and o3-mini models only**
