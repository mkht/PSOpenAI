## DESCRIPTION
Creates and executes a batch from an uploaded file or input objects.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Start-Batch -FileId 'file-abc123'
```

Creates and executes a batch from an uploaded file. You need to upload formatted jsonl file to the OpenAI storage in advance.

### Example 2
```powershell
PS C:\> $BatchInputs = @()
PS C:\> $BatchInputs += Request-ChatCompletion -Message 'Good morning.' -Model gpt-4o-mini -AsBatch -CustomBatchId 'custom-1'
PS C:\> $BatchInputs += Request-ChatCompletion -Message 'Good night.' -Model gpt-4o-mini -AsBatch -CustomBatchId 'custom-2'

PS C:\> Start-Batch -InputObject $BatchInputs
```

Creates and executes a batch from input items.  
You can create a batch input item by using the Request-ChatCompletion cmdlet with `-AsBatch` switch.

## PARAMETERS

### -BatchInput
Specifies batch input objects.

```yaml
Type: Object[]
Parameter Sets: BatchObject
Required: True
Position: 0
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue, ByPropertyName)
```

### -FileId
Specifies a input file id that is uploaded on the OpenAI storage in advance.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: FileId
Aliases: input_file_id
Required: True
Position: 0
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue, ByPropertyName)
```

### -CompletionWindow
The time frame within which the batch should be processed. Currently only "24h" is supported.

```yaml
Type: String
Aliases: completion_window
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 24h
```

### -Endpoint
The endpoint to be used for all requests in the batch. Currently "/v1/chat/completions", "/v1/embeddings", and "/v1/completions" are supported.

```yaml
Type: String
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: /v1/chat/completions
```

### -OutputExpiresAfterSeconds
The number of seconds after the anchor time that the file will expire. Must be between 3600 (1 hour) and 2592000 (30 days).

```yaml
Type: Int32
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -OutputExpiresAfterAnchor
Anchor timestamp after which the expiration policy applies. Supported anchors: `created_at`.

```yaml
Type: String
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -MetaData
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.
